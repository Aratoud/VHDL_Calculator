# VHDL CALCULATOR

This is a simple post-fix calculator capable of handling 4 basic arithmetic operations on 3 bit decimal numbers

## Getting Started

I have developed the calculator using Xilinx Vivado software and implemented the HDL code on Basys3 FPGA board.
In order to add the source files to your project, you just have to add them to your [ProjectName].srcs folder in your project directory

### Prerequisites

The code can be tested on any FPGA board with VGA output. But the development was done on Vivado software and Basys3 board. 

## Development

Most of the credit goes to the book *Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design* written by Stephen D. Brown,  Zvonko G. Vranesic
I read the book and tried to implement the multiplier circuit myself.
Additionally, I could have not understand and done my project without the help of my Digital Design professor [Ergin Atalar](http://www.umram.bilkent.edu.tr/~ergin/mycv/index.php) and my TA [Alireza Javanmardi](javanmardiee.bilkent.edu.tr)
